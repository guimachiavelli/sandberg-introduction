# Introduction with BuzzFeed Quizzes
I usually find it quite weird to speak about myself. I think part of that is due to having been trained as a journalist and somehow being more interested in other people’s stories and words, and working more in editing and assembling their ideas.

So, when faced with the task of presenting myself, I turned to the internet to give you some sort of semblance of what and who I am. more specifically, I took loads of buzzfeed and etc quizzes, and I’m very excited to present what turned out to be a journey of deep soul searching and discovery.

## Development
To edit content, use `content/slides.yml`. Each item represents one slide to which text, illustrations, links and videos can be added. Videos are currently hidden and overlaid on the top of the slide to play Youtube video soundtracks.

## Build
Run `make build`

## Deployment
Run `make deploy`

## TODO
* abstract presentation logic
* remove all hacky stuff for video/sound playing
* possibly add flags for hiding/showing elements on request
